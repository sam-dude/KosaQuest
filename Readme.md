# One-pager: KosaQuest

## 1. TL;DR
KosaQuest is a gamified, AI-powered cultural learning platform that transforms indigenous language preservation into an engaging learning experience. Users progress through sequential challenges featuring proverbs, expressions, and folktales, earning XP and verifiable NFT badges on EduChain. The platform addresses the critical need for culturally relevant educational tools while providing meaningful recognition for both learners and cultural contributors who preserve oral heritage.

## 6. Narrative
Samuel, a 68-year-old storyteller, opens GriotChain XP Quest on his smartphone. He navigates to the contributor portal and records a traditional proverb in his native language, adding context about when it's used. The AI processes his submission and generates interactive quiz questions. 

Meanwhile, Maya, a 16-year-old student, logs in for her daily lesson. She works through a story Samuel uploaded last week, earning 50 XP by correctly matching proverbs to their meanings. When she reaches 500 XP, the app celebrates with animations and mints her first NFT badge - "Proverb Apprentice" - on EduChain. She immediately shares it on WhatsApp with friends, sparking their curiosity about their own cultural heritage.

The next day, Samuel receives a notification that his content helped Maya achieve her milestone, and he earns a "Cultural Keeper" NFT recognizing his contribution to preserving his cultural heritage.
